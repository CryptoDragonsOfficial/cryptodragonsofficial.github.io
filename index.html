                    <h2>Lore</h2>
                    <p class="lore-text">Keeping the giants separated was the dragons promise to humans, for it brought about a universal
                        balance.
                        A balance that paved the way for mankind to flourish for almost a century. As the legendary
                        dragons
                        of
                        old now slumbered, those promises were slowly forgotten and the giants were once again uniting.<br/><br/>

                        Farms and fishing villages of Molidyr now burned in the night but the giants were not finished.
                        They
                        stood united and staunch, their armor stained with the blood of the innocent as they gathered at
                        the
                        gates of the fortress village.<br/><br/>

                        A monk, praying silently between pillars of gold calmly turns to his most committed devotee,
                        "Send a
                        message to Tirramar immediately, Molidyr has fallen."<br/><br/>

                        As news from the monks reached the Council of Tirramar, the armies of men and firebreathers of
                        the
                        desert began to convene.<br/><br/>

                        Look to the legendary dragons for protection once more.<br/><br/>

                        For without them, we are hopeless.<br/><br/>

                        Good luck!</p>

                <h2>iNFTs or Infused Non Fungible Tokens are digital card collectibles like NFTs.</h2>
                <p>Within CryptoDragons, NFTs have no P2E mechanics, whereas iNFTs are infused with P2E mechanics. This
                    is
                    what
                    gives iNFTs
                    their name and how we differentiate between the two. iNFTs have gaming utility, NFTs do not.

                    One of these infused mechanics called magic has dual utility in CryptoDragons. At game release we
                    will
                    showcase the full
                    mechanics of magic, presently it is a yield boost when used to protect your farmers.

                    iNFTs, NFTs and ALL accompanying artwork are original pieces of art created by privately
                    commissioned
                    artists of the
                    highest standard. CryptoDragons iNFTs started as hand drawn sketches and were reworked until they
                    reached
                    the masterpieces they are today.

                    iNFTs have other infused mechanics, including attack, health and unique ability which are displayed
                    on
                    the
                    card too.

                <p>*100% of fee automatically added to liquidity and locked (burned).</p>
                <p>**DRAGON tokens will be used for Governance via a Snapshot system and are released at a rate
                    of
                    20%
                    annually.
                    This is performed on the anniversary of CryptoDragons launch date and is hard coded into the
                    contract, therefore, $DRAGON tokens cannot be minted until a year has passed.
                    25% of DRAGON tokens are retained by CryptoDragons to ensure that the team, and by extension
                    the
                    community, have a strong voice in the continued development of CryptoDragons.</p>

            <div class="slide">
                <h3>FIRE Token</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Purchasing power</li>
                    <li>Address: TBD</li>
                    <li>Chain: Polygon</li>
                    <li>Max Supply: Unlimited</li>
                    <li>Emission Rate: 3 FIRE per block (89.5% Farms and Pools | 10% Dev | 0.5% Reward Vault)

                </ul>
                <p>There is no hard cap on the supply of $FIRE, making it an inflationary token.
                    FIRE's primary function is to incentivize providing liquidity by offering rewards. Without
                    block
                    rewards, there is less incentive to provide liquidity.
                    Reducing the amount of$FIRE tokens generated per block (block emissions) is possible and
                    CryptoDragons will do this when necessary and only after consulting users.
                </p>

            <div class="slide">
                <h3>Anti-Whale System</h3>
                <p>CryptoDragons has a withdrawal limit of 0.15% of TVL per transaction which acts to avoid
                    sudden
                    price
                    movements.</p>
                <h3>Non-stop Burns</h3>
                <p>CryptoDragons has a 2% transaction fee across all transactions.

                    100% of ALL fees are automatically split and added to liquidity and locked (burned) during
                    every
                    transaction.

                    CryptoDragons uses this automatic burn system to add liquidity constantly. This avoids the
                    need
                    for
                    a
                    burn wallet and avoids sudden price movements created by a manual burn system.

                    Use of an automatic burn system naturally generates sell orders. The sell orders you see are
                    the
                    result
                    of fees being burned to add liquidity.</p>
